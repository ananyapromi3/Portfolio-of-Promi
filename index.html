                            <h4>Writing, My Best Friend</h4>
                            <p>
                                Since my early teenage, I have developed a passion for writing. It started in my fifth
                                grade when I won a collection of teen fiction novels as the second prize in an art
                                competition. Gradually, I earned the name “book-loving girl” at our house. Even it often
                                happened that after completing two or three novels continuously, I suffered from a
                                headache!<br />
                                However, I ended up reading most of the books from the large two full-of-books almirahs
                                in our house. After that, I had been a member of the mobile library, Bishwo Shahitto
                                Kendro, that used to come to our school twice a week.<br />
                                I read every book twice: first, to enjoy the story; second, to follow the writing style.
                                It always haunted me: how do the writers create so much an impact on the readers? How do
                                they write so interestingly that I cannot stop reading them?
                                I also wanted to create such powerful weapons to enamor the audience. Therefore, I took
                                my pen, many times, to create such amazing works. The more I tried the more I realized
                                how much devotion and practice it requires.<br />
                                From the time I learned to write a full sentence in Bengali, I wrote in my diaries what
                                I wished. I wrote poems, stories, songs, or any real-life incidents.<br />
                                At first, I wrote for myself; I wrote because I loved to. It felt relieved when I poured
                                down everything going through my mind on the striped white pages. So eventually these
                                diaries have been my best friends, whom I can trust, I can tell and share everything.
                                They don't judge me, advise me, but just listen without complaining.<br />
                                However, as I read many books and wrote many things every day, I developed good writing
                                skills. One day, while reading some of my previous writings, I found them quite
                                engaging. That day I cherished publishing a novel someday.<br />
                                Writing a novel requires a lot of devotion, imagination, and hard work. Though I was
                                good at writing, I never tried to write such a long one. Most of my writings were about
                                my days, my friends and family, or they were random short stories. I started reading
                                books on the rules of writing, read the autobiographies of my favorite authors. I
                                realized one thing: read, read and read, and don't stop writing whatever it is. At
                                first, no doubt, I lacked the patience to write a whole novel. I filled up many
                                notebooks with unfinished stories that I hoped to grow as a novel.<br />
                                In the meantime, I wrote lots of short stories; sent them to the newspaper offices to
                                publish them in their magazines. I got my writings published in the school magazines
                                many times, but so wanted them to publish in some magazine that many people read. I sent
                                my writings to the monthly magazine for publishing, And my twenty-second attempt became
                                successful at last- they published my short story! However, as soon as I started
                                grinning out of extreme happiness, it dimmed because I found they made a printing
                                mistake to type my name in the top right corner. (In the next monthly edition, they
                                admitted their mistake though.<br />
                                In my eighth grade, I finished writing a hundred-page novel on collapsing a residential
                                building. The incident of the Savar Rana Plaza Tragedy in our country
                                provoked me so much that I wanted to picture their miseries. But I was too young to make
                                it heart-touching. It was not enough good for publication.<br />
                                After two years, I completed another long story; it was about a girl's life. But it also
                                did not turn out to be a good one. However, I did not put my pen aside. I started many
                                stories, could not come to a conclusion or come up with an attractive storyline. But I
                                never stopped trying. I tried to look through people, look outside. While going
                                somewhere in the car, I stared at the people sitting on the truck in front of us,
                                created a story about him in my head. I started observing every little detail of the
                                people around me- how they talk, how they walk or look. Because I needed it to describe
                                the characters vividly and uniquely in my stories.<br />
                                When I was in grade twelve, my literature teacher inspired me; he loved my writing
                                style. With his guideline, my dream came true. I published my adventure novel "Chander
                                Gari" at the national book fair of Bangladesh. This time, I came up with a thrilling
                                plot and successfully animated the characters as I wanted. Here, my thoughts and
                                real-life experiences, and the characteristics of my friends and nearby people helped me
                                a lot to portray the scenarios. I became one of them, among the group of six friends,
                                who overcome all the hitches in their way to make a journey to their destination. While
                                writing, I felt like a powerful person because I owned the power to control the
                                characters, the situations, and everything. And it is the most beautiful part of
                                writing.<br />

                            <h4>Math Olympiad, A Significant Part of My Life</h4>
                            <p>
                                Eight years ago, my innate passion for mathematics paved the beginning of my Math
                                Olympiad journey. In my first math camp, a lot of what we had been taught felt like
                                incomprehensible gibberish. However, the camp had felt like a second home; it was as if
                                I had rediscovered my truest self amidst the numerous fervid faces of the campers — the
                                young, unsociable I had suddenly found my interests aligning with my peers. This was a
                                place where I unerringly belonged. No doubt, I had fallen in love with the math camp and
                                the campers. Returning home, I remained overwhelmingly preoccupied with the fun memories
                                of the camp. The next year, I determinedly worked to be there again. This communal
                                exposure triggered an introduction to contrasting aspects of life — success and failure;
                                motivation and dejection. Instances of pure delight and exhilaration (as I brought home
                                my first medal and slews of accolades) were weighed down by the pressures of keeping
                                pace with my talented peers. Nonetheless, whenever I grew despondent, my campmates
                                unfailingly cheered me on. I fondly recall one of my friends warmly entreating me,
                                “Look, you may not belong in the top six, but you are amongst the top ten. Can you not
                                surpass only four? How hard could that be?” His words served to vanquish my gloom and
                                inspired me to actualize my dreams.<br />
                                I had always been fascinated by the training mentors in the camp. Their way of teaching
                                left such a profound impact on me that I tried incorporating that same amount of
                                bedazzling amusement into the math workshops that I helped supervise in my own area. I
                                managed to enrapture my students and garnered a large attendance of both underclassmen
                                and upperclassmen. No doubt, participating in the national math olympiads broadened my
                                ambitions and motivated me to stay true to my passions. I gained a new vigor to carry on
                                with my other jobs as well. The problem-solving and critical-thinking skills I inherited
                                from this scope, benefited me to excel in Competitive-programming and Olympiad Physics.
                                I constantly thrived to improve myself. By the ninth grade, I was already completing
                                advanced topics from the Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics textbooks assigned to
                                eleventh and twelfth graders. Complex math problems that had never seemed conceivable
                                before, started fascinating me; I jammed page after page with scribbled solution
                                approaches; books that had appeared scary before seemed bewilderingly appealing. Whilst
                                drawing a nephron structure on the eve of a biology exam, I caught sight of a
                                complicated geometric figure on the previous page and proceeded to figure it out,
                                unawarely brushing off the task at hand. One other day at the school library, I had
                                loudly blurted out “Yes!” rather enthusiastically as I finally happened to solve a
                                problem that had remained unsolved in the days past. Contrite with embarrassment as
                                people threw disapproving glances my way, Archimedes's eureka moment resonated deep
                                within!<br />
                                I had been in love with math for years. It was more than a dream— to hold onto our
                                red-green flag as I represented Bangladesh in the International Mathematical Olympiad
                                (IMO). My dream remained unfulfilled. Yet, I am not disheartened, its pursuit led me to
                                unravel the mysterious beauty of mathematics. The math camp has instilled in me, an
                                unforgettable lesson— to forever persevere. Obsessing over one problem for days,
                                gawking at someone's stunning solution, spending countless hours on an exam and still
                                wishing I had gotten a few minutes extra, plugging in earphones to avoid solution
                                spoilers, watching movies, playing cards, late-night debates on thoughtful topics,
                                singing songs all-together— all of these encapsulate my fond memories of the math camp.
                                Being a part of this 'mathematical wonderland' is a blessing in my life. Second, to the
                                traits bestowed upon me by my parents, the math camp is undeniably the only other thing
                                that has molded me into the person I am today.

                            <h4>What does it mean to you to be educated?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Education is the power to change the world. It is not only bookish knowledge. It is the
                                weapon to make our world better for us. <br />
                                I want to study computer science. Being educated in this field will give me the power to
                                serve my country, and my world through the knowledge I learn. Doing research, and
                                gaining practical knowledge is the goal of my education. And I believe Georgetown
                                college would be the best environment where I can be truly educated.
                                I have an appeal to cryptography. At first, I was not so sure about pursuing my higher
                                studies in this field. I was not sure I could serve my country through this. But when I
                                watched the movie The Imitation Game, I got inspiration from the life story of Alan
                                Turing. He did extraordinary things to serve his country and countryman through what he
                                learned and loved. I realized, if someone believes in himself and what he can do, he can
                                assist others. It is what I understood by being educated.
                                Alan Turing's biography taught me- if I have a great passion for something, I can serve
                                the world with that.
